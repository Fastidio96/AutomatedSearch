# Automated Search project

### This is a test and probabily is not working or most of the features are broken.

### Description
For me, this was just a test project to learn the limitations and capabilities of the "WebView" library by creating a bot for MS Rewards.
Unfortunately, the library I used is too limited and hard to use for my needs, so I switched to another library and abandoned this project.
If you'd like to contribute or fork it, feel free to use it.
